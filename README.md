# Web Development Module Collection

This repository contains a collection of small, modular web development components that can be combined to build a complete website. Each task should take approximately 3-6 hours to complete and focuses on a specific functionality or UI element.

## Submission Guidelines

1. Create a single HTML file named with your name and the task code (e.g., `john_smith_HC001.html`)
2. Include all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript within this single file
   - Place CSS in a `<style>` tag in the `<head>` section
   - Place JavaScript in a `<script>` tag before the closing `</body>` tag
3. For commit messages and descriptions:
   - Commit message: Include your name and task code (e.g., "John Smith - HC001")
   - Commit description: Detailed explanation of what changes you made and any challenges you faced
4. Example:
   - Commit message: "John Smith - HC001"
   - Commit description: "Created responsive navigation bar with hamburger menu for mobile. Fixed overflow issues on small screens and implemented smooth transitions."

## Coding Guidelines for Consistency

1. **HTML Structure**
   - Use HTML5 doctype: `<!DOCTYPE html>`
   - Include proper meta tags for viewport and character encoding
   - Use semantic HTML elements (header, nav, main, section, footer, etc.)
   - Include comments to mark major sections

2. **CSS Guidelines**
   - Use a consistent naming convention (BEM recommended: Block__Element--Modifier)
   - Include a CSS reset at the top of your styles
   - Use CSS variables for colors and repetitive values
   - Follow mobile-first approach with responsive breakpoints
   - Comment your CSS for complex styling

3. **JavaScript Guidelines**
   - Use ES6+ syntax when possible
   - Add comments to explain complex logic
   - Use descriptive variable and function names
   - Avoid global variables, use namespaces or modules
   - Handle errors appropriately
